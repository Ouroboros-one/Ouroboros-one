### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Hello everyone! My name is Jai Deshmukh and I am a second-year student at Virginia Tech. At VT, I am majoring in Software Systems and minoring in Astronomy, as I enjoy the seeing the possibilites of humans in space and on other worlds, as well enjoying the thrill of exploration overall.

I currently work as an intern through MITRE and VT, in which I am currently working on moving object detection and containment. 

Outside of school and work, I am the Kotlin Technical Lead for the Virginia Tech Developer Student Club and the Student Engineering Council representative for the AIAA (American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics) at VT. 

My hobbies include camping, hiking, and making projects I'm enthusiastic about. If you have any questions or would like to reach out me to about anything, my email is djai@vt.edu.

- Jai
